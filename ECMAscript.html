<div class="main">
<h3>A Brief History:</h3>
<p>
In 1961, the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) was founded to standardize computer systems in Europe.
Standardization at the time was needed as computer systems were growing rapidly, and it was helpful for spreading knowledge
and having it available for anyone who wants to learn. ECMA International is currently based to Geneva, Switzerland.
Many companies submit their languages and other technologies for ECMA to standardize.<br/><br/><br/>
One standardization they provided back in 1997, which has since been revised many times, was called ECMAscript.
This document explains the standards, specifications, and principals to be able to create a scripting language.
Scripting languages are used by other mechanisms in order to perform tasks. One of the biggest ways this is seen
in in internet browsers. ECMAscript is the guide that was used to create JavaScript, the most popular scripting language,
among other widely used languages. However, since ECMAscript is updated and revised every few years, that does not necessarily
mean that JavaScript and other scripting languages must change in accordance with those specifications. <br/><br/>
</p>

<h3>What does this mean for me?</h3>

<p>
Since ECMAscript is constantly changing and adding new features, it can be beneficial to stay up to date and be aware of
what new things you can do with scripting languages and how browsers react to it. As a full-stack / web developer, 
you may even get interview questions about the different versions of ECMAscript. Not to mention, a quality programmer also 
adheres to industry standards, so look to the newest ECMAscript documentation to be the best you can be!<br/><br/>
